# Port-scanner
Code to scan ports and check if they are open or closed. To run code simply enter command
```
python portscanner.py
```

## Comments
If termcolor module doesn't exist, run command 
```
pip install termcolor
```
or alternatively comment out line 2 of code in portscanner.py with its areas of use as it is not necessary to run, but merely for aesthetics.
